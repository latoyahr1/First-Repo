WEEK 8!

Week 8 has definitely been the busiest week for me. I have so much work to do, and honestly half of it is late work but its getting done and im almost where I need to be. I'v been working on CSS, JQuery, Javascript, my portfolio, and some networking fundamentals. It's a lot of work but it has to be done. I'm excited to learn more and can't wait to start the up and comming projects. 

Who ever was responsible for the trip to Zendesk I want to thank you so much for that opportunity. Everything about the people and the place was just amazing. Even if I never see that place again, I will never forget that experience or the  staff.

A special thanks to Jillian,
me and my classmates thought she did a wonderful job.
