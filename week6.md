Week 6 has been a very busy week, we was givin a lot of work but it was expected. I focused more on HTML, CSS and code school more then JavsScript this week. I need to get more intune with JavaScript because its more of a challenge for me, so if anyone have any ideas of how i can get a better understanding about it inform me please and thank you.
