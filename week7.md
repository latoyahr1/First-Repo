Week 7 Blog!
This week has definitely been a challenge for me. There's a lot of things thats due , and a lot to be done. I'm currently working on code school, my portfolio-css skeleton, java-script and at the same time thinking about what i'm going to blog about. I feel like i'm all over the place doing so much but i'm barley completing anything. I wish I could find a place with more space in my head so that when i'm thinking it's clear. So not only will I be able to complete my work but get organized and turn my assignments in on time. My report card is not ok, although it's a reflection of me, I soon will be where I need to be in order to complete this program.
